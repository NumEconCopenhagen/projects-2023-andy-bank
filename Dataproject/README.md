# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **analysing the Danish housing market for overvaluation** and is about: Evaluating the Danish housing market for potential overvaluation during the period 1996-2021. We will analyze the trend of real house prices and real disposable income over time and calculate the price-to-income ratio and price-to-rent ratio to determine whether it is overvalued as of 2021Q2. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We apply Data from Danmarks statisk and Nationalbanken in this assignment. 

1. Data_opg_2.csv (Nationalbanken) 
1. Pricerent.csv (Danmarks statistik)

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

**Group Members**: The members of this group are: Anders Rosman Nielsen (QCV954) and Frederik Koldkj√¶r Bank (HLN311)
