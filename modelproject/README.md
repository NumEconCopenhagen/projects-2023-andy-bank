# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow Model** and is about a macroeconomic model that investigates the sources of economic growth in an economy.

The solow model assumes that a single company is representative of the entire economy.
The model is based upon a labor force, a production function that yields constant returns to scale and diminishing returns to capital accumulatio as seen in previous macroecnomics courses.


The reuslts of our project can be seen from running our project "modelproject.ipynb".
 Our code gives two ways of solving the solow model, an analytical solution using the sympy tool, in order to derive the steady-state values of capital and output per capital.
Furtermore a numerical solution using the scipy.optimize tool to find the steady-state values by maximizing the output per capita equation. The numerical solution tests for convergence by providing five different initial values of capital per capita.

 Lastly we plot the convergence to the steady state using different growth rates in the technological factor.
